            Tic-tac-toe is a simple and popular game that is played by two players on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking the empty squares with their symbols, either X or O. The goal is to make a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of the same symbol. The player who does this first wins the game. If the grid is filled and no one has made a line of three, the game is a draw. Tic-tac-toe is also known as noughts and crosses, Xs and Os, or X and 0.
